MineCommit converts Minecraft Java Edition saves into a **Git-friendly** format. By leveraging Git's mature version control and delta compression algorithms, MineCommit achieves:

- 🗜️ **Extreme Space Efficiency**: Each incremental backup averages only a fraction of the original save size
- ⚡ **Fast Backup and Restore**: Streaming parallelism via [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon), NBT parsing via [`simdnbt`](https://github.com/azalea-rs/simdnbt), and Git I/O via [`gitoxide`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide)

Any question? Please read [FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) or feel free to open an issue.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

MineCommit depends on an external `git` binary for the `commit` and `checkout` commands. If Git is not installed, please [install Git](https://git-scm.com/install/) first.

### Using the GUI

We provide a GUI build for Windows users. Download the `minecommit-gui` executable from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HairlessVillager/minecommit/releases) page.

The GUI is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (frontend), providing a WYSIWYG interface for basic backup and restore workflows.

### Using the CLI

The CLI provides fine-grained control over execution details. You can get it from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HairlessVillager/minecommit/releases) or build it yourself:

```sh
cargo install --path . --bin minecommit
```

> [!NOTE]
> Building from source requires a recent **Rust Nightly** toolchain (due to `simdnbt`). Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/): `rustup toolchain install nightly`.

#### Step 1: Prepare

You need to define the following two paths:

1. **Save Path (`$SAVE_DIR`)**: The specific world directory under `.minecraft/saves/` (containing `level.dat`).
2. **Git Repo Path (`$GIT_DIR`)**: A bare Git repository to store backup data.

#### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

For the first backup, create a bare Git repository:

```sh
git init --initial-branch main --bare $GIT_DIR
git --git-dir $GIT_DIR config gc.auto 0
git --git-dir $GIT_DIR config core.logAllRefUpdates true
```

Ensure your Git commit identity is set:

```sh
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

If nothing is displayed, set your global Git identity:

```sh
git config --global user.name $YOUR_USER_NAME
git config --global user.email $YOUR_USER_EMAIL
```

#### Step 3: Execute Backup

```sh
minecommit commit $SAVE_DIR $GIT_DIR --branch main --init --message "Your backup note" --repack
```

This reads the save at `$SAVE_DIR`, creates an initial commit on the `main` branch of the bare repository at `$GIT_DIR`, and automatically repacks loose objects.

```

</details>

#### Step 4: Restore Backup

If `$SAVE_DIR` already exists, MineCommit will rename it to `$SAVE_DIR.bak` before restoring.

```sh
minecommit checkout $SAVE_DIR $GIT_DIR --commit "main~1"
# Restores to the previous commit on the main branch
```

<details>
<summary><code>minecommit checkout --help</code></summary>

```text

  <SAVE_DIR>  Path to your save
  <GIT_DIR>   Path to the bare Git repository

Options:
  -c, --commit <COMMIT>  Commit-ish to checkout (commit ID or revision expression, e.g. HEAD~1, branch~2)
  -h, --help             Print help
```

</details>

### Additional Commands

#### Cloud Sync (Vanilla Minecraft, Safe Fast-Forwards Only)

MineCommit can synchronize its existing **bare** backup repository with any normal Git remote, including a private GitHub repository. Minecraft itself remains a normal vanilla Java installation and the world remains under `.minecraft/saves`.

The desktop app includes a first-time wizard for people who do not use Git: choose whether you already have a GitHub account, create an empty private repository, paste its HTTPS address, then create and upload the first backup. The cloud card shows the committed time and device for local and cloud backups; this metadata travels with each backup commit.

For Linux Mint Debian Edition and other Debian-based distributions, download the `MineCommit-…-x86_64.deb` file from the GitHub Release and open it with the system package installer. The package declares Git as a dependency; the `.tar.gz` remains available for users who prefer a portable download.

```sh
# Associate a local MineCommit bare repository with a remote once.
minecommit remote add $GIT_DIR git@github.com:YOUR_USER/my-world.git --branch main

# After creating a local backup, safely upload it. This fetches first and never force-pushes.
minecommit commit $SAVE_DIR $GIT_DIR --init --message "Initial cloud backup"
minecommit push $GIT_DIR --branch main

# On another computer: initialise an empty bare repo, add the same remote,
# then fetch, fast-forward, and restore the remote world.
git init --initial-branch main --bare $GIT_DIR
minecommit remote add $GIT_DIR git@github.com:YOUR_USER/my-world.git --branch main
minecommit sync $SAVE_DIR $GIT_DIR --branch main
```

`minecommit sync` is the intended **sync-before-playing** action. It fetches the selected branch, compares it to the local bare-repository branch, and restores only when the remote is a fast-forward. `minecommit push` is the intended action after making a MineCommit backup; it fetches again before a normal non-force push.

If both devices have changed since their common backup, MineCommit reports a divergence and stops. It never merges Minecraft histories automatically, never force-pushes, and keeps the existing local save as a timestamped `.snapshot` before a restore. Backup and restore also refuse to run while Minecraft holds the world's `session.lock`.

Use Git Credential Manager for HTTPS or an SSH key for SSH remotes. MineCommit does not implement GitHub OAuth and rejects HTTPS URLs containing embedded credentials.

<details>
<summary>Flatten / Unflatten (without Git)</summary>

If you want to flatten a save to a plain filesystem directory (without Git integration), use `flatten` and `unflatten`:

```sh
# Deconstruct save into a flattened format
minecommit flatten $SAVE_DIR $FLATTENED_DIR

# Reconstruct save from the flattened format
minecommit unflatten $SAVE_DIR $FLATTENED_DIR
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Utils (debugging)</summary>

```sh
# Dump chunk NBT data to stdout
minecommit utils chunk $REGION_FILE --chunk-x 0 --chunk-z 0
```

</details>

## 🔬 How It Works

MineCommit's design is based on a core insight: most of a Minecraft save's volume is concentrated in `region/*.mca` files, which contain substantial spatial redundancy (duplicate blocks and biomes across chunks) and temporal redundancy (minimal differences between adjacent backups).

MineCommit "flattens" the complex `.mca` binary format into small, Git-diffable files through a handler pipeline:

| Handler                 | Input Pattern           | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChunkRegionHandler`    | `**/region/r.*.*.mca`   | Splits chunk NBT into per-chunk sections and other data |
| `EntitiesRegionHandler` | `**/entities/r.*.*.mca` | Flattens entity region files                            |
| `PoiRegionHandler`      | `**/poi/r.*.*.mca`      | Flattens point-of-interest region files                 |
| `GzipNbtHandler`        | `**/*.dat`              | Decompresses and processes Gzip-compressed NBT files    |
| `RawHandler`            | user-defined            | Copies arbitrary files as-is                            |
| `IgnoreHandler`         | user-defined            | Explicitly ignores matching files                       |

Each handler operates within its own namespaced workspace. The ODB (Object Database) abstraction layer decouples storage from handler logic, supporting both local filesystem backends (`LocalFsOdb`) and Git-backed storage (`LocalGitOdb`) with parallel read/write operations via `rayon`.
